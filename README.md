# BookmarkWizard

Simple chrome plugin to manage bookmarks. Along with normal bookmark functionalities, the user should also be able to optionally add a reminder message with each bookmark. So everytime the user visits one of the bookmarked websites, the reminder message would appear as a popup/notification to remind the user why they bookmarked the site.
